*Find Your Pace*

_Find Your Pace_ (FYP) is a run pace calculator that 
estimates your predicted pace for training
runs and races based on today's weather.

Running in circles trying to figure out if
you ran a 7:19 or a 7:17 minutes per mile
pace in your last race? _Find Your Pace_
does the math for you! Just enter your
personal best time from a race or time trial,
the race distance, the temperature, dew 
point, and wind speed from that day, and
where you're running today, and FYP will 
tell you your pace and estimate your 
running performance today. 

This web app was built by runners, for
runners. As runners, we are laser-focused
on time and challenging ourselves to run
each race faster than we've ever run before.
We were frustrated that our race times always
seemed to slow down in the summer heat (especially
in New York and DC!), no matter how many 
miles we put in. As it turns out, the
temperature, humidity, and wind speed 
hace a significant effect on running
pace! Let's say you run a personal best
half marathon time in the cool temps and 
low winds of early March in Brooklyn while 
you're in peak marathon training shape. When 
the mercury rises come July, there's a good chance 
your time at a 10k will only be a few seconds 
faster per mile than your HM personal best beacause 
of the heat, and a summer half could be upwards of
20 seconds slower per mile. You may feel slugish,
but racing and training at these paces serve the
same cardio benefit as your faster winter paces!
Enter your times, the weather, and your location
into FYP, and see how much the summer heat and 
humidity are affecting your pace. If you're beating
those times, congrats! That means you've gotten 
faster and fitter. Either way, after enduring
the heat and humidity of summer training, come
fall, your times will drop with the temps and 
you'll feel like Superman. 

We used to use several different online 
calculators to figure out our training paces, 
whether the weather and humidity were going 
to affect our ability to run, and how much 
to adjust our paces by, etc, and we realized
we could _build_ something greater than 
the sum of its parts. Now we're spending less
time calculating, and more time running 😉.

_Find Your Pace_ is built using HTML, 
JavaScript, jQuery, and JSON.

We look forward to building out more features on
_Find Your Pace_ and making it even more user-friendly.
In the meantime, let us know what you think and what
_you_ would like to see next!
